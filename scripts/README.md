# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for repository management and maintenance.

## Available Scripts

### 🧹 `cleanup-branches.sh`

Intelligently identifies and deletes obsolete branches from the remote repository.

**What it does:**
- Fetches latest branch information with `--prune`
- Analyzes branch status and merge state
- Categorizes branches into:
  - **Protected branches**: Never deleted (main, develop, refactor, releases)
  - **Branches with unmerged work**: Flagged for review (not deleted)
  - **Obsolete branches**: Safe to delete (work already merged)
- Shows unique commit counts for unmerged branches
- Verifies merge status before deletion
- Prompts for confirmation before deletion
- Deletes specified branches from remote
- Provides detailed summary of operations

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/cleanup-branches.sh
```

**Branch categories:**
1. **Protected branches** (🛡️ never deleted):
   - `main` - Production branch
   - `develop` - Main development branch
   - `refactor` - Active refactoring work
   - `release/*` - Release branches

2. **Branches with unmerged work** (⚠️ review required):
   - Shows unique commit count
   - Should be manually reviewed before deletion
   - May contain important work

3. **Obsolete branches** (✓ safe to delete):
   - Work has been merged elsewhere
   - Old completed feature branches
   - Closed PR branches

**Safety features:**
- Requires explicit "yes" confirmation
- Shows detailed list with merge status
- Identifies branches with unmerged commits
- Reports success/failure for each deletion
- Provides post-cleanup tips

### 🚀 `create-release-branch.sh`

Creates a new release branch from `develop` with proper versioning.

**What it does:**
- Reads current version from package.json
- Suggests next version number
- Creates a new release branch
- Updates version in package.json
- Commits and pushes the new branch
- Provides next steps guidance

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/create-release-branch.sh
```

**Example flow:**
```
📦 Current version: 0.1.0-beta.1
💡 Suggested next version: 0.2.0-beta.1

Enter the new version (or press Enter to use suggested): [Enter]

📋 Creating release branch for version: 0.2.0-beta.1
Continue? (yes/no): yes

✅ Release branch created successfully!
📌 Branch: release/v0.2.0-beta.1
```

**Next steps after running:**
1. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
2. Test the release thoroughly
3. Fix any bugs found during testing
4. Create PR to merge into `main`
5. After merging to main, merge back to `develop`
6. Tag the release

### 🔧 `maintain-github-config.sh`

Validates and maintains GitHub configuration files in the `.github` directory.

**What it does:**
- Checks core configuration files (copilot-instructions.md, copilot-rules.json, copilot-settings.json)
- Validates agents directory structure and content
- Validates copilot rules directory and rule files
- Checks workflows directory and YAML syntax
- Validates additional configuration (CODEOWNERS, templates, etc.)
- Performs consistency checks across related files
- Provides detailed health report with color-coded output

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/maintain-github-config.sh
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ File existence and valid structure
- ✅ JSON syntax validation for config files
- ✅ Content size validation (ensures files aren't empty)
- ✅ Directory structure and organization
- ✅ Cross-reference validation (e.g., agents mentioned in README)
- ✅ Workflow file syntax (basic checks)

**Output format:**
```
🔧 GitHub Configuration Maintenance
====================================

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1️⃣  Checking Core Configuration Files
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓ copilot-instructions.md exists
  ✓ copilot-rules.json has valid JSON syntax
  ...

📊 Summary Report
  Total checks performed: 28
  Errors found:          0
  Warnings found:        0

✅ All checks passed! GitHub configuration is healthy.
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - All checks passed or only warnings found
- `1` - Critical errors found that need attention

**When to use:**
- Before committing changes to `.github` configuration
- As part of CI/CD pipeline validation
- Regular maintenance checks
- After updating GitHub Copilot rules or agents
- When troubleshooting Copilot configuration issues

**Maintenance schedule:**
- Run before major releases
- Run after updating conventions or patterns
- Run when adding new agents or rules
- Include in pre-commit hooks if desired

## Prerequisites

All scripts require:
- Git installed and configured
- Bash shell (Linux/macOS/WSL on Windows)
- Proper permissions to push to the remote repository
- Node.js (for version parsing in create-release-branch.sh)
- `jq` command-line JSON processor (for maintain-github-config.sh)
  - Install on Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install jq`
  - Install on macOS: `brew install jq`
  - Install on Windows: `choco install jq` or download from [stedolan.github.io/jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

## Branch Management Strategy

For a complete overview of the branch management strategy, see:
- [Branch Strategy Documentation](../docs/BRANCH_STRATEGY.md)

## Contributing

When adding new scripts:
1. Follow the same structure and style
2. Include colored output for better UX
3. Always confirm destructive operations
4. Provide helpful error messages
5. Document the script in this README
6. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x script-name.sh`

## Maintenance

These scripts should be reviewed and updated when:
- Branch naming conventions change
- New types of automated branches are created
- Versioning strategy changes
- Workflow processes are modified
